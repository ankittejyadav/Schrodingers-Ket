• Created a visualization of error to capture noise in Qubits at a scale that is visible for us to observe with color differences
• Total number of shots used: 100 (random walk) + 5 (color generation), Backends used:  IonQ, Qiskit Aer Simulation
• Integrated Qiskit, a leading quantum computing python library, to facilitate communication with quantum backends
